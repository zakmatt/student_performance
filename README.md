# Student Performance Prediction

## Create the environment
In order to create the environment you first have to run the creation of the environment which can be done using the script included in this project. To do so, first change the execution type of `setup_env.sh` and then run it with one of two options; dev or prod. This will not only create the environment for development or production, respectively, but also export global variables which are later used to track and save our experiments

### Create the environment
```bash
chmod +x setup_env.sh
./setup_env.sh dev
```
